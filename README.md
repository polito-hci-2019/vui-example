# Sample of a Web-based Voice User Interface

This repository is an example, developed in classroom, for getting started with voice user interfaces.

It uses the Web Speech API (experimental) for speech-to-text and text-to-speech operations.

Tested in Chrome 57+, Firefox 70+, and Safari 10.1+. Please, notice that speech-to-text capability does not work in Safari and Firefox.
